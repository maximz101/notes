== Principle 1
Write clear and specific instructions

.Tactic 1: Use delimiters
----
* Triple quotes: "'"
* Triple backticks:'"
* Triple dashes: -
* Angle brackets: ‹ ›

----
Step 1: ...

== Transforming
* Language translation,
* Guessing the language,
* Spelling and grammar checking (ex: Proofread and correct the following...)
* Tone adjustment (ex : from slang to a business letter),
* Format conversion (ex: from JSON to an HTML)


== Expanding
We can modify the temperature (0 \<= t \<= 1) to have more "creative" output.

.python example
----
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages,
    0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output (0-1)
)
result = response.choices[0].message["content"]
----

== Chatbot
It's possible to create a conversational chatbot such as ChatGPT using the OpenAI API since it allows passing JSON formatted messages as follows :
----
[{"role": "system", "content": "system context"}, {"role": "user", "content": "my prompt"},]
----
* "_system_" role allows setting the context
* Other roles are the conversation participants, for instance "_user_" and "_assistant_"
* for each call to the API, we pass the entire conversation back to keep the context up to date. (to the _openai.ChatCompletion.create()_ for instance)

[source, python]
.example
----
messages =  [
{'role':'system', 'content':'You are an assistant that speaks like Shakespeare.'},
{'role':'user', 'content':'tell me a joke'},
{'role':'assistant', 'content':'Why did the chicken cross the road'},
{'role':'user', 'content':'I don\'t know'}  ]

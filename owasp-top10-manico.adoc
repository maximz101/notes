. Broken access control
.. principle of least privilege
.. difficult to test in automated tools (because scanners are not aware of custom policy
.. difficult to build, lack of framework support
.. Best Practices
... DO NOT hardcode roles, instead hardcode the name of the feature (ex: ARTICLE_EDIT)
...  Build a centralized access control mechanism
... Design access control so all requests must be authorized
... Implement data-contextual access control
... Deny by default
...  Right data for AC decision
... Apply changes in real time
... Groups
... Build admin screen first

. Cryptography
.. TLS everywhere
.. No plaintext
.. Use HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
.. Google Tink or Libsodium for encrypting data at rest

. Injection
.. Validation is not the solution, email’s with sql injection are valid emails (ex: jim’or1’1!=@manicode.com is a valid email)
.. Always parametrize queries
.. XSS : Injection Cross Site Scripting

. Insecure Design
.. Security first approach

. Security misconfiguration

. Vulnerable/Outdated components

. Identification and Authentication failures

. Software and Data integrity failures

. Security logging and monitoring failures

. Server-side Request Forgery
